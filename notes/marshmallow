- correctness of data is important 
- marshmallow package helps to verify the client data, but also to verify the data that we send back.

- object = lives in application memory
- to transfer or store that object, we have to convert it into a storable or transferrable format and that format is will be a stream of bytes. 

- marshmallow allows developers to define schemas --> which can be used to represent a field in various ways 
          - required and validation
- **Schema** class : to specify the fields for the objects that we want to serialize/deserialize
